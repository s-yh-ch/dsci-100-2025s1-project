    "A research group in Computer Science at UBC, The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), led by Frank Wood, is collecting data on players of the video game MineCraft in order to understand how people interact with video games and trends in their behavior. In order to target their recruitment efforts, they would like to know, **\"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"**\n",

    "In order to investigate the general question above, this project will specifically address: <br>\n",
    "**Can age, total hours played, maximum duration of sessions, and frequency of sessions of a player predict of whether the player is subscribed to the game's newsletter?**\n",

Recall from Figure 1 that around 73.2% of players are subscribers. Models using age and max duration of session (Model 2) and using all 4 predictors (Model 4) gave an accuracy that was essentially equal to the proportion of players that are subscribers, and do not appear to have any meaningful predictive power."

As there appeared to be some differences in subcription when looking at gender and when looking at age distribution and experience together, these may be useful to factor in when building a model.
